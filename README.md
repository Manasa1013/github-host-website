STEERING CONTROL FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE 
J Hasmitha1,M Shivani1,M Manasa1



  Abstract—An autonomous vehicle is capable of sensing its atmosphere through detector management of the vehicle at any time. A completely autonomous vehicle is capable of nursing the veteran human drivers. The steering system is an important part of the autonomous vehicle which is controlled by varied counting of the steering angle according to the obstacle position of the lane. This vehicle has obstacle swerving abilities with  a detector, lidar and it analyses the space to associate in going past the obstacles that are present in the same lane. The foremost manoeuvre from the motive force is to quickly move to a different lane, drive past the obstacle and move in the intial lane. LKA(lane keeping assist) system is used to detect when the vehicle deviates from the lane and adjust the steering angle mechanically.


Keywords—Autonomous cars, autonomous vehicles, steering control, model predictive control, lane keeping assist, steering control using matlab, steering angle, obstacle avoidance, automation.

I.   INTRODUCTION
Autonomous vehicles is the next emerging disruptive technology. All the top notch automobile industries are relentlessly working on developing a fully autonomous self driving cars aging day to day with improved results.
